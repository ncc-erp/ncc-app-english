# Mezon English Exam App — Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision & Goals

**Vision**: A lightweight English proficiency assessment tool embedded inside Mezon, designed to evaluate users' English level and drive clan membership growth through a "result-gating" mechanic.

**Growth Loop**:

```
User opens Channel App → Takes exam → Sees partial results (teaser)
    → Joins clan to unlock full results → Stays in clan community
```

**Goals**:

- Provide a quick, credible English level assessment (5-10 minutes)
- Drive organic clan growth via the result-unlock mechanic
- Collect user English proficiency data for community insights
- Zero-friction entry: no signup beyond existing Mezon login

## 3. User Journey

### Entry Points & Authentication

The app supports **two initial entry flows**, both leading to a Mezon-authenticated session:

- **Entry Point A (Direct Web Access)**:
  1. User visits the web app URL directly (e.g. `https://english-exam.vercel.app`).
  2. App detects no active session or hash data.
  3. Displays Landing Page with overview and prominent **"Login with Mezon"** button.
  4. User clicks "Login with Mezon" → Redirects to Mezon OAuth2 (`oauth2.mezon.ai/oauth2/auth`).
  5. User approves → Redirects back to `/api/auth/callback` → Session cookie set → Redirected to `/exam`.

- **Entry Point B (Embedded Mezon Channel App)**:
  1. User opens the app from inside a Mezon channel iframe.
  2. App receives signed `?data=...` parameter in URL.
  3. App auto-authenticates silently via `/api/auth/mezon-hash` → Session cookie set.
  4. User arrives directly at the welcome screen ready to start.

### Core Exam & Growth Flow (Post-Login Happy Path)

1. **Welcome Screen**: User sees exam overview (30 questions, ~12 mins, CEFR level assessment).
2. **Start Exam**: User clicks "Start Exam" → Attempt created in DB → Timer starts.
3. **Take Exam**: Completes 30 questions across Grammar, Vocabulary, and Reading. Answers are autosaved per question.
4. **Submit Exam**: Server scores attempt, maps score to CEFR level (A1–C2), and sets `result_status = 'partial'`.
5. **Partial Result Screen (Teaser)**:
   - Displays CEFR level badge (e.g. "B1 - Intermediate") and overall score percentage.
   - Displays blurred/locked cards for: Detailed Skill Breakdown, Weakness Analysis, Improvement Tips, and Certificate.
6. **Clan Join Call-to-Action**:
   - User sees banner: _"Join [Clan Name] on Mezon to unlock your full detailed report!"_
   - Clicks "Join Clan" → Opens Mezon clan invite deep link / URL.
7. **Verify & Unlock**:
   - User returns to app and clicks "I've Joined — Unlock Report".
   - App calls `/api/membership/verify` → Server checks Mezon Bot API for user membership.
   - Upon confirmation, `result_status` updates to `'full'` → Full breakdown unlocked!

## 5. Exam Design (MVP)

### Structure

| Section               | Questions | Time        | Difficulty Mix        |
| --------------------- | --------- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| Grammar               | 10        | ~3 min      | 4 easy, 3 med, 3 hard |
| Vocabulary            | 10        | ~3 min      | 4 easy, 3 med, 3 hard |
| Reading Comprehension | 10        | ~6 min      | 3 easy, 4 med, 3 hard |
| **Total**             | **30**    | **~12 min** |                       |

### Question Format

- All multiple choice (4 options, 1 correct)
- Questions stored in Supabase `questions` table
- Randomized order within each section
- Random subset from larger pool (e.g., 30 from 100+)

### Scoring

- Each correct answer = 1 point (raw score: 0-30)
- Weighted by difficulty: easy=1pt, medium=2pt, hard=3pt
- Max weighted score: 4×1 + 3×2 + 3×3 = 19 per section = 57 total
- Map weighted score to CEFR-aligned levels:

| Weighted Score | Level | Label              |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------ |
| 0-10           | A1    | Beginner           |
| 11-20          | A2    | Elementary         |
| 21-30          | B1    | Intermediate       |
| 31-40          | B2    | Upper Intermediate |
| 41-50          | C1    | Advanced           |
| 51-57          | C2    | Proficient         |

## 6. Result Display Strategy

### Shown Immediately (FREE — the "teaser")

- **Level badge** with CEFR label (e.g., "B1 - Intermediate")
- **Overall score percentage**
- **Ranking**: "Better than X% of all test takers"
- **Time taken** to complete
- A motivational message based on level

### Locked Until Clan Join (the "unlock")

- **Skill breakdown chart** (Grammar: 70%, Vocabulary: 85%, Reading: 60%)
- **Weakness analysis**: "Your weakest area is Grammar — specifically conditionals and passive voice"
- **Improvement tips**: 3-5 actionable suggestions per weak area
- **Percentile comparison**: Detailed radar chart vs. average scores
- **Downloadable PDF certificate** with name, level, date
- **Historical progress** (if retaken)

**Why this split works**: The teaser satisfies curiosity ("what's my level?") but creates desire for the detailed breakdown. The locked section has genuine educational value — users feel the clan join is "worth it" rather than just a paywall.

## 7. Clan-Join Unlock Flow

### Architecture

```
User clicks "Unlock" → Opens clan invite link in new tab
    → User joins clan in Mezon
    → Returns to exam app
    → Clicks "I've joined! Check now"
    → App calls server → Server checks membership via bot API
    → If member: unlock results, save to DB
    → If not: "Not found yet. Try again in a moment."
```

### Membership Verification

**Primary method**: Server-side bot using `mezon-sdk`

- Bot is pre-installed in the target clan
- On verification request: `clan.users.fetch(userId)`
- If found → mark `unlocked_at` in Supabase
- If not found → return "not yet a member"

**Fallback method**: Listen for `AddClanUser` event via bot WebSocket

- When user joins, bot receives event with `user_id`
- Bot calls webhook to app server → Auto-unlock if pending

### Client UX

- "Check membership" button with 5-second cooldown between clicks
- Auto-poll every 10 seconds for 2 minutes after user clicks unlock
- Visual state: "Checking..." → "Not found, try again" / "Unlocked!"
- Deep link format: `mezon://clan/invite/{INVITE_CODE}` (fallback: web URL)

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

### Security & Anti-Cheat

- Questions and correct answers NEVER sent to client
- Client only receives: question_text, options (without correct flag)
- Scoring happens server-side only
- Timing validated server-side (reject if too fast: <30s for 30 questions)
- Rate limit: max 1 attempt per 24 hours per user
- Hash validation on every API request (Mezon auth)

### Performance

- Page load < 2 seconds
- Question transition < 200ms
- Result computation < 1 second
- Support 100 concurrent users (Supabase free tier)

### Privacy

- No email collection (Mezon profile only)
- Exam data retained 1 year, then anonymized
- GDPR: user can request data deletion
- No third-party analytics in MVP

### Mobile UX

- Touch-friendly option buttons (min 44px tap target)
- Horizontal swipe between questions
- Progress bar always visible
- Works in Mezon mobile app iframe

## 10. Open Questions for Founder

1. **Which clan?** Is this for one specific clan, or configurable per deployment?
2. **Clan invite link**: Do you have a permanent invite link? Or should the bot auto-generate one?
3. **Retake policy**: 24h cooldown acceptable? Or different?
4. **Question content**: Who writes the questions? Do you have a bank, or should we seed with AI-generated ones?
5. **Branding**: Clan name/logo to display? Custom theme colors?
6. **Standalone access**: Should users be able to access via web URL (not just Mezon channel), using OAuth2?
7. **Multiple clans**: Could this be deployed for different clans (multi-tenant)?
8. **Certificate**: Is a downloadable PDF certificate wanted for MVP?
9. **Bot setup**: Do you already have a Mezon bot with a token, or do we need to create one?
10. **Target language**: UI in English only, or Vietnamese + English?
